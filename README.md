# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description
This week's challenge is to create an application called `Note Taker` that can be used to write and save notes. The application will use an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Note that the application's front-end has already been created om the [Starter Code Repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka), so make sure to clone the starter code repository and make my own repository with the starter code. The primary task is to build the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
