# Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

## Description
This week's challenge is to create an application called `Note Taker` that can be used to write and save notes. The application will use an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Note that the application's front-end has already been created om the [Starter Code Repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka), so make sure to clone the starter code repository and make my own repository with the starter code. The primary task is to build the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```

## Installation & Usage & Tests
The first thing to do is to clone the [Starter Code Repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).

Type `npm init` in the terminal to get `package.json`.

Type `npm install express` in the terminal to install dependencies for the project.

Type `node server.js` to initiate the server.

Note that there is no testing for this project!

## Final Thoughts
Although this week's project was not particularly hard; however, I had to google, watch Express.js tutorial video, and read class notes to better understand purpose of different express methods and identify the correct syntax for setting up the server. For instance, I forgot the syntax of diffrent express methods, such as get() and post(). Overall, the project itself was interesting because this was my first time handling back-end web application framework; in addition, I got exposed to using Heroku - a platform service that allows developers to build, run, and operate applications on the cloud server.
